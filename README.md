# Case Study: Helping Civil Rights Organizations Create a Dataset for Racially Polarized Voting (RPV) Analyses

This code contains an example of how you might use maup, similar to what we did in the Case Study on the website [redistrictingdatahub.org](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/tools/support/helping-civil-rights-organizations-create-a-dataset-for-rpv-analysis/).

## Getting Started

### Data
- [VEST 2020 CT Precinct Boundary and Election Results](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/vest-2020-connecticut-precinct-and-election-results/)
- [U.S. Census CT Blocks](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/connecticut-block-pl-94171-2020/)
- [U.S. Census CT Counties](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/connecticut-county-pl-94171-2020/)


#### Folder Structure
After making the name changes to the block-assignment files, you should create a "raw-from-source" and load in the above files. This file structure will allow you to run the notebook without making changes.

## Questions

Send a message to the Redistricting Data Hub [Help Desk](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/tools/support/) at help@redistrictingdatahub.org with questions about this code, data and the redistricting process!

## Built With

We are used Python and Jupyter Notebook to show how we processed the data. We like Jupyter Notebook because it provides a very easy way to visualize the data as you are working.
